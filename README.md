# VirtualCellChallenge2025

Predicting gene expression responses in human embryonic stem cells using AI-driven modeling of single-cell perturbation data.

### ðŸ“Œ Introduction

The **Virtual Cell Challenge 2025**, hosted by the Arc Institute and sponsored by NVIDIA, 10X Genomics, and Ultima Biosciences, tasks participants with building models that predict gene expression responses in a held-out cell typeâ€”**H1 human embryonic stem cells**â€”using CRISPRi perturbation data from other cell types.

This project presents our solution to the challenge, combining advanced machine learning techniques with domain knowledge in single-cell biology to generalize cellular responses across contexts.

### ðŸ§¬ Methodology

Our approach consists of the following core components:

* **Model Type**: \[e.g., Transformer-based regressor / Graph Neural Network / TabNet]
* **Input Features**:

  * Pseudo-bulk expression vectors per perturbation
  * Gene ontology embeddings
  * Cell-type condition vectors
* **Training Strategy**:

  * Supervised learning on 150 training perturbations
  * Domain adaptation for H1 generalization
  * Combined loss: differential expression + global MAE + perturbation similarity
* **Regularization**: Dropout, layer normalization, and perturbation contrastive loss

Our goal is to not only achieve high accuracy but also ensure **biological interpretability** and **robustness** on unseen contexts.


### ðŸ“‚ Data

We use the official challenge datasets:

* âœ… **Training Set**: 150 CRISPRi perturbations across diverse cell types
* ðŸ“Š **Validation Set**: 50 perturbations for live leaderboard evaluation
* ðŸ”’ **Final Test Set**: 100 perturbations on H1 cells (released Oct 2025)

We also incorporated external perturb-seq datasets such as:

* Tahoe-100M
* scBaseCount
* Replogle et al., Nadig et al., Jiang et al.

### ðŸ§ª Limitations & Future Work

* Currently optimized for transcript-level accuracy; not yet integrated with protein or epigenetic features.
* Exploring integration with scVI for probabilistic modeling and uncertainty estimates.
* Plan to release a web-based demo for in silico perturbation simulation.
